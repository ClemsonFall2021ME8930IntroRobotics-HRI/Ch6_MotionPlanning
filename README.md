# Ch7_MotionPlanning
##Problem Statement:
This repository contains the code for various offline motion planning algorithms. Motion planning is a term used in robotics for the process of breaking down the desired movement task into discrete motions that satisfy movement constraints and possibly optimize some aspect of the movement. It involves getting a robot to automatically determine how to move while avoiding collisions with obstacles. This repository includes the following offline motion planning algorithms:
-Grid based motion planning algorithms
  -Uniform cost search algorithm
  -Dijkstra algorithm
  -A* algorithm
-Sampling based motion planning algorithms
  -PRM Planner
  -RRT 
  -RRT*
